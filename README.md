# AnyCloud Example: Secure TCP Client

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a secure TCP client with PSoC® 6 MCU and CYW43xxx connectivity devices. In this example, TCP client establishes a secure connection with a TCP server through SSL handshake. Once the SSL handshake completes successfully, the TCP client controls the user LED, turning ON or OFF, based on the command received from the TCP server.

This example uses the [Wi-Fi Middleware Core](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/wifi-mw-core) library of the AnyCloud SDK. This library enables Wi-Fi based application development by bundling together various other libraries - FreeRTOS, Wi-Fi Host Driver (WHD), lwIP TCP/IP stack, Mbed TLS, and Cypress secure socket. The Cypress secure socket library provides an easy-to-use API by abstracting the network stack (lwIP) and the security stack (Mbed TLS).

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

- Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en). 
- Install a Python Interpreter if you don't have one. This code example is tested using [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/). 
- [OpenSSL](#prerequisites)

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager**. You can also access it from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name:** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where the application is created.

5. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run *Cygwin.bat*.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the CLI section to download or clone the repository, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Modify `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match with that of the Wi-Fi network credentials that you want to connect. These macros are defined in the *network_credentials.h* file. Ensure that the Wi-Fi network that you are connecting to is configured as a private network for the proper functioning of this example.

3. Ensure your computer is connected to the same Wi-Fi access point that you have configured in step 2.

4. Determine the computer's IP address.

   Type the following command in the command shell based on your operating system to determine the IP address:

   Windows: `ipconfig`

   Linux: `curl ifconfig.me`

   Mac OS: `ifconfig |grep inet`
   
5. Change the `TCP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` macro defined in the *secure_tcp_client.h* file to match with the computer's IP address. For example, if your computer's IP address is 
   192.168.18.9, then update the macro as shown below:
    ```
        #define TCP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS             MAKE_IPV4_ADDRESS(192, 168, 18, 9)      
    ```
   Note that the TCP client connects to a fixed port number "50007" of the TCP server used with this example and this is not user configurable.
6. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

7. Ensure Python interperter (see **Software Setup**) is installed on your computer

8. Open a command shell from the project directory and run the python TCP secure server (*tcp_secure_server.py* ) . The python script is located under *{project directory}\python-secure-tcp-server*. In the command shell opened in the project directory, type in the following command:

   ```
   python tcp_secure_server.py
   ```


   **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your computer allow access to the Python software so as to allow communication with the TCP client. For more details on enabling Python access, see this community [thread](https://community.cypress.com/thread/53662)


9. Program the board.


   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox**:

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.


   - **Using CLI**:

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:

   ```
   make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
   ```

   Example:


   ```
   make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
   ```


   **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

   After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the text, shown in Figure 1, is displayed on the UART terminal. Note that Wi-Fi SSID and the IP address will be different based on the network that you have connected to.

   **Figure 1. UART Terminal Showing Wi-Fi Connectivity Status**

   ![Figure 1](images/uart-terminal-output.png)

10. From the Python secure TCP server, send the command to turn the LED ON or OFF  to the TCP client( '0' to turn LED OFF and '1' to turn LED ON). Observe the user LED (CYBSP_USER_LED) turning ON/OFF on the board.

   **Figure 2. LED Status on TCP Server**

   ![Figure 2](images/tcp-server-output.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation

### Resources and Settings

Table 1 lists the ModusToolbox resources used in this example, and how they are used in the design.

##### Table 1. Application Resources
| Resource   |  Alias/Object     |    Purpose     |
| :-------   | :------------     | :------------  |
| SDIO (HAL) | sdio_obj | SDIO interface for Wi-Fi Connectivity |
| UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port |
| LED (BSP) | CYBSP_USER_LED | User LED to show output |


This example uses the Arm Cortex®-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSoC 6 MCU to execute an RTOS task: TCP Client task. At device reset, the default Cortex-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep.

In this example, TCP client establishes a secure connection with a TCP server through SSL handshake. During the SSL handshake, client presents its SSL certifcate for verification and also verifies the server's identity to which it is connecting to. The client's SSL certificate used in this example is a self signed SSL certificate. See [Creating a Self-Signed Certificate](#creating-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate) for more details. Once the SSL handshake completes successfully, the TCP client controls the user LED ON or OFF based on the command received from the TCP server.

### Creating a Self-Signed SSL Certificate
The TCP client demonstrated in this example uses a self-signed SSL certificate. This means that there is no third-party certificate issuing authority, commonly referred to as CA, involved in the authentication of the client. Servers connecting to the this client must have an exact copy of the SSL certificate to verify the client's identity.

Do the following to generate a self-signed SSL certificate:

#### Prerequisites
The OpenSSL library is required to generate your own certificate. Run the following command in your local environment to see if you already have OpenSSL installed.

```
which openssl
```
Install OpenSSL if the `which` command does not return a path. 

| Operating System  |  Installation    |
| :------- | :------------    | 
| Windows | [Windows OpenSSL installer](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm) |
| Ubuntu Linux |`apt-get install openssl`| 
| macOS |[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):`brew install openssl`| 

#### Generate SSL Ceritificate and Private Key 
Run the following commands to generate the SSL certificate and private key. 

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout client.key -out client.crt
```

Follow the instructions in the command window to provide the details required for creating SSL certificate and private key.

The *client.crt* file is your clients's certificate and *client.key* is your client's private key.
